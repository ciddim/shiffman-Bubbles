# shiffman-Bubbles
My attempt at bubbles collision.

Simple p5 project, with a minimal sketch.js file.

Easily customisable bubbles behavior.

- nbBubbles is the number of bubbles.
- repulsion determines if the bubbles are going to bounce off of each other or be attracted to one another
- Gravity turns gravity ON or OFF.
